## AP Computer Science Principles - Unit 2, Assignment 9 - Unit 2, Checkpoint 2 Reflection
Due: Thursday, October 23rd 2025

### Unit 2 Checkpoint 2 Reflection:

1. Create a file in your Assignments folder titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_CP2_Compression_Reflection.md`.

2. Copy/paste the code at the bottom of this assignment.

3. For each question, respond to each of the following prompts.
   * What answer choice(s) did you select?  **Write out the complete answer choice(s).**
   * What answer choice(s) were correct? **Write out the complete answer choice(s).**
   * If you answered **correctly**, identify one **incorrect** answer choice and explain the error in reasoning that could have led someone to select that answer choice.
   * If you answered **incorrectly**, explain your own own error in reasoning and justify why the correct answer choice is correct.

**Example 1/**

> ## Question 1/ Which of the following is a true statement about data compression?
> * My answer choice was D, There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data.
> * The correct answer choice was D, There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data.
> * Someone may have incorrectly selected A, Data compression is only useful for files being transmitted over the Internet.  Their error in reasoning might have been recognizing that while data compression is useful for files being transmitted over the internet, that is not its only use.  For example, data compression is also useful for maximizing storage space.

**Example 2/**

> ## Question 2/ Digital images are often represented by the red, green, and blue values (an RGB triplet) of each individual pixel in the image.  A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image.  Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image?
> * My answer choice was B, Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning the new value to the corresponding pixel in the image.  The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from black to white.
> * The correct answer choice was C, Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255.  The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.
> * My error in reasoning was that I didn't recognize that changing colors to gray scale loses data.  For example, it would be hard to tell if dark gray was originally dark blue, dark green, dark red, etc.  Since data is lost, this is lossy compression.  In lossless compression, the original data can be reconstructed.  Taking the negative of an image is lossless.  It involves subtracting values from 255, which is a process that can be reversed to get the original image back

4. Commit your progress.  Remember to write an appropriate commit message.  For example, *"Completed unit 2 checkpoint 2 reflection."*

A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image.  Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image?

## Question 3/ Which of the following statements is true about the advantages of lossy and lossless compression? **Select two answers**

## Question 4/ A user compresses a high resolution image before transmitting it.  However, when the image is received, the result is blurry.  What most likely explains the reduction in image quality?

## Question 5/ Which of the following statements about byte pair encoding is true?

## Question 6/ Which of the following strings can be shortened using byte pair encoding?
