**AIM:** What is byte pair encoding and how do computing devices use it as a lossless compression technique?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

- [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.2</ins>: Apply computational thinking to a variety of tasks.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can describe what byte pair encoding is and how computing devices use it as a lossless compression technique.
- [ ] I can simulate byte pair encoding with a given string.
- [ ] I can analyze a given string to determine whether or not it can be compressed using byte pair encoding.

**AGENDA:**

1. Songs and Lyric Patterns Exploration
2. [A Word from Aloe Blacc](https://studio.code.org/courses/text-compression/units/1/lessons/1/levels/1)
3. Exploring Byte Pair Encoding ([Code.org Compression Widget](https://studio.code.org/courses/text-compression/units/1/lessons/1/levels/2))
4. Class Discussion
   * When data is compressed, what two items contribute to the total file size?
   * What strategies were most effective in achieving maximum compression?
   * What strategies were least effective in achieving maximum compression?
   * Did any strategies make the file size larger? If so, what happened?
   * What makes some strings more or less challenging to compress than others?
   * Is byte pair encoding always an option?
   * Why is byte pair encoding lossless?
5. Check for Understanding
