**AIM:** How can we leverage error analysis to improve our understanding of binary, overflow errors, and roundoff errors?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

- [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.2</ins>: Apply computational thinking to a variety of tasks.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can identify, correct, and explain my own errors in relation to binary, overflow errors, and roundoff errors.
- [ ] I can describe potential misconceptions (and how to avoid them) in relation to binary, overflow errors, and roundoff errors.

**AGENDA:**

1. Error Analysis Discussion
2. HW Preview
3. Full Exam Review
4. Check for Understanding

**HOMEWORK:**
