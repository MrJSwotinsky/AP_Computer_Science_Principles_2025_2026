      <b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
      What do you think of when you hear the word, "overflow"?<br>
      What do you think of when you hear the word, "roundoff"?<br><br>
      <b>Be prepared to share your responses.</b>

**AIM:** What causes overflow and roundoff errors and what do they look like in action?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

- [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.2</ins>: Apply computational thinking to a variety of tasks.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can identify examples of information that can and cannot be stored by a single bit.
- [ ] I can identify scenarios in which overflow errors will occur and explain why.
- [ ] I can identify scenarios in which roundoff errors will occur and explain why.
- [ ] I can describe what overflow and roundoff errors look like in action.
- [ ] I can describe what overflow and roundoff errors have in common as well as how they differ from each other.

**AGENDA:**

1. "Overflow" and "Roundoff" Discussion
2. What is a Single Bit Good For?
3. Too Much Information and Too Few Bits
     * Overflow Errors
     * Roundoff Errors
4. Overflow and Roundoff Errors in Action
5. Overflow and Roundoff Errors: Similarities and Differences
6. Check for Understanding

**HOMEWORK:**
