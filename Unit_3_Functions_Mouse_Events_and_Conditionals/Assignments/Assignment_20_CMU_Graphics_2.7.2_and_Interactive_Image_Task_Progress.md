## Unit 3, Assignment 20 - CMU Graphics 2.7.2 and Interactive Image Task Progress
Due: Monday, December 8th 2025

### CMU Graphics 2.7.2:
Complete [CMU Graphics](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/) exercise set 2.7.2 (if-elif-else conditionals)

**Successfully complete enough exercises to earn at least 2 points.**

### Interactive Image Task Progress:
1. Navigate to the CMU Graphics [sandbox](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/ide).
2. Open `LastNameFirstInitial_Interactive_Image_Task_Code.py`.
3. Continue building, prototyping, and testing.<br>

**Consider using this as an opportunity to...** <br>
* ...add an if-elif-else conditional to your code.
* ...revisit previous interactive image task progress assignments to ensure you are on track to completing the interactive image task by Friday, December 12th.
* ...troubleshoot an existing issue.
* ...seek feedback from a peer and use it to further develop your interactive image.
* ...continue developing your interactive image in some other way.

            <ul>
              <li>Remember to use the same commit message for both your interactive image video and code.</li>

            </ul>
            As you work, whenever you make significant progress (or if you haven't commited in a while), remember to save your code, commit your interactive image video, and commit your interactive image code.<br><br>
            <b>For each commit...</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Remember to write a short and simple commit message to describe your progress.</li>
              <li>Remember to write a more detailed commit description to describe your progress and next steps.</li>

**Don't be afraid to revisit the Empathize, Define, and Ideate stages of the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process as needed.**

**Capture any updates in your [design planner](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Planner.pdf) and upload them to your Interactive Image Task folder.**

**As you work, remember to refer to the Interactive Image Task [description](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Unit_3_Functions_Mouse_Events_and_Conditionals/Tasks/Interactive_Image_Task/Description_Interactive_Image_Task.md), [example](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/tree/main/Unit_3_Functions_Mouse_Events_and_Conditionals/Tasks/Interactive_Image_Task/Sample), and [pathway to success](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Unit_3_Functions_Mouse_Events_and_Conditionals/Tasks/Interactive_Image_Task/Interactive%20Image%20Task%20-%20Pathway%20to%20Success.pdf) to guide you in progressing toward mastery.**
