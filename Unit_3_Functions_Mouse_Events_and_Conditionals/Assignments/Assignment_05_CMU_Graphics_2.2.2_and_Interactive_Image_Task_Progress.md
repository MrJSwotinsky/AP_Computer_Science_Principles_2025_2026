## Unit 3, Assignment 5 - CMU Graphics 2.2.2 and Interactive Image Task Progress
Due: Monday, November 3rd 2025

### CMU Graphics 2.2.2:
Complete [CMU Graphics](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/) exercise set 2.2.2 (`onMousePress()` and `onMouseRelease()`)

**Successfully complete enough exercises to earn at least 3 points.**

### Interactive Image Task Progress:
1. Navigate to the CMU Graphics [sandbox](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/ide).
2. Open `LastNameFirstInitial_Interactive_Image_Task_Code.py`.
3. Continue building, prototyping, and testing.

**At minimum**, add the following to your interactive image:<br>
  * At least one call to `onMousePress()`<br>
  * At least one call to `onMouseRelease()`

<table>
      <tr>
         <td>
            <b>REMINDER:</b><br>
            As you work, whenever you make significant progress (or if you haven't commited in a while), remember to save your code, commit your interactive image, and commit your code.<br><br>
            <b>For each commit...</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Remember to write a short and simple commit message to describe your progress.</li>
              <li>Remember to write a more detailed commit description to describe your progress and next steps.</li>
              <li>Remember to use the same commit message for both your emoji and code.</li>
              <li>Remember to use the same commit description for both your emoji and code.</li>
         </td>
      </tr>

**Don't be afraid to revisit the Empathize, Define, and Ideate stages of the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process as needed.**

**Capture any updates in your [design planner](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Planner.pdf) and upload them to your Interactive Image Task folder.**

**As you work, remember to refer to the Interactive Image Task [description](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Unit_3_Functions_Mouse_Events_and_Conditionals/Tasks/Interactive_Image_Task/Description_Interactive_Image_Task.md), [example](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/tree/main/Unit_3_Functions_Mouse_Events_and_Conditionals/Tasks/Interactive_Image_Task/Sample), and [pathway to success](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Unit_3_Functions_Mouse_Events_and_Conditionals/Tasks/Interactive_Image_Task/Interactive%20Image%20Task%20-%20Pathway%20to%20Success.pdf) to guide you in progressing toward mastery.**
