## Unit 3, Assignment 2 - Interactive Image Task Define Stage and My First Function Code
Due: Tuesday, October 27th 2025

### Interactive Image Task Define Stage:
1. Complete the **Define** column of your [design planner](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Planner.pdf) to capture your engagement in the Define stage of the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process.<br>
2. Scan your design planner and save it as `LastNameFirstInitial_Task_Design_Planner.pdf`.
3. Upload your design planner to your Interactive Image Task folder.
4. Commit your progress.  Remember to write an appropriate commit message.  For example, *'Completed define column.'*

**As you work forward on this task, keep in mind you may need to go back to revisit the define stage.**

### My First Function Code:
1. Navigate to the CMU Graphics [sandbox](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/ide).
2. Write a short student defined function that draws an image composed of at least three shapes.
    * Remember to name your function in a meaningful way.  For example, if your image draws a house, consider naming it `draw_house`.
    * Remember to create at least two parameters for your function to set the x and y location of the image it will draw. 
3. Have your function draw its image in at least three different locations on the canvas by calling it three different times and passing different arguments to its parameters each time.
4. Run and revise your code as needed until you are able to confirm that your program works as intended.
5. Once you have confirmed that your program works as intended, capture a screenshot of the canvas, save it as `LastNameFirstInitial_My_First_Function_Image.png` and upload it to your assignments folder. *Remember to include an appropriate commit message.*
6. Create a new file in your assignments folder titled `LastNameFirstInitial_My_First_Function_Code.py`, copy/paste your code from the CMU Graphics sandbox, and commit.  *Remember to include an appropriate commit message.*
