Due: Monday, November 17th 2025

### Interactive Image Task Response to Feedback:
1. Upload a scan of your peer feedback to your assignments folder (filename:`LastNameFirstInitial_Interactive_Image_Peer_Feedback_Protocol_Peer_Feedback.pdf`)
2. Upload a scan of your self reflection to your assignments folder (filename:`LastNameFirstInitial_Interactive_Image_Peer_Feedback_Protocol_Self_Reflection.pdf`)
3. Navigate to the CMU Graphics [sandbox](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/ide).
4. Open `LastNameFirstInitial_Interactive_Image_Task_Code.py`.
5. Continue prototyping and testing.
6. Use this as an opportunity to respond to feedback from a peer.

**Don't be afraid to revisit the Empathize, Define, and Ideate stages of the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process as needed.**

**Capture any updates in your [design planner](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Planner.pdf) and upload them to your Interactive Image Task folder.**

**As you work, remember to refer to the Interactive Image Task [description](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Unit_3_Functions_Mouse_Events_and_Conditionals/Tasks/Interactive_Image_Task/Description_Interactive_Image_Task.md), [example](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/tree/main/Unit_3_Functions_Mouse_Events_and_Conditionals/Tasks/Interactive_Image_Task/Sample), and [pathway to success](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Unit_3_Functions_Mouse_Events_and_Conditionals/Tasks/Interactive_Image_Task/Interactive%20Image%20Task%20-%20Pathway%20to%20Success.pdf) to guide you in progressing toward mastery.**
