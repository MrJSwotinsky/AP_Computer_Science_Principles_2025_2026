      5. Click <b>and hold</b> the mouse.  While you are holding it, drag it to a new location on the canvas.  Then release.  What happens?<br>
      6. Exam the code.  Based on your observations interacting with the program, what do you think the functions `onMousePress()` and `onMouseRelease()` accomplish?<br><br>

**AIM:** How can we leverage the functions `onMousePress()` and `onMouseRelease()` to make our programs interactive?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.3</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can leverage the functions, `onMousePress()` and `onMouseRelease()` to make my programs interactive.
- [ ] I know the required parameters for `onMousePress()` and `onMouseRelease()` as well as how to incorporate them into the body of the `onMousePress()` and `onMouseRelease()` definition. .
- [ ] I understand that `onMousePress()` and `onMouseRelease()` are **NOT** student-defined functions.
- [ ] I understand that I can have only **ONE definition** for `onMousePress()` and **ONE definition** for `onMouseRelease()`.
- [ ] I understand that I do not call `onMousePress()` and `onMouseRelease()` in my program.  Instead, CMU Graphics calls `onMousePress()` and `onMouseRelease()` whenever the user presses or releases the mouse.

**AGENDA:**

1. Program and Code Analysis
2. `onMousePress()`
3. `onMouseRelease()`
4. Check for Understanding
5. Homework Head Start
