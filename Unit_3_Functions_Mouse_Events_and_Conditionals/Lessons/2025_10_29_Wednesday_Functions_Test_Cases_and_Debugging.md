      Examine the following code **without running it**, describe what you expect to see on the canvas, and why:<br><br>
<pre><code># Function Definition:
def draw_design(x_center, y_center, outer_circle_size, inner_circle_size, outer_circle_color, inner_circle_color):
  Circle(x_center, y_center, outer_circle_size, fill = outer_circle_color)
  Circle(x_center, y_center, inner_circle_size, fill = inner_circle_color)
# Function Call(s):
draw_design(100, 100, 50, 25, 'purple', 'yellow')
draw_design(200, 200, 75, 50, 'orange', 'red')
draw_design(200, 200, 50, 75, 'green', 'blue')</code></pre>

**AIM:** How can we define and call our own functions in CMU Graphics?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.2</ins>: Apply computational thinking to a variety of tasks.
 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.3</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I know the essential ingredients of functions and function calls.
- [ ] I can write-student defined functions that draw images composed of a few shapes.
- [ ] I can call student-defined functions.

**AGENDA:**

1. Code Analysis
2. Test Cases and Debugging
3. Check for Understanding
4. Homework Head Start

**HOMEWORK:**
