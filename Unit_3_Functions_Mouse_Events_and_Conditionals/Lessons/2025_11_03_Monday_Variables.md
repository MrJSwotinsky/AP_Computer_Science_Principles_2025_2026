      <b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
      1. Navigate to the CMU Graphics sandbox and open the file `trees.py`<br>
      2. Run `trees.py`.  What do you see?<br>
      3. Click the mouse <b>one time</b>.  What happens?<br>
      4. Click the mouse <b>several times</b>.  What happens?<br>
      5. Examine the code.  Based on your observations interacting with the program, what do you think the function `onMousePress()` accomplishes?<br><br>
      <b>Be prepared to share your responses.</b>

**AIM:** How can we leverage variables and properties to manage the complexity of our code?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.3</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can describe what variables are and how they are used to manage the complexity of code.
- [ ] I can leverage variables and proeprties to manage the complexity of my code.

**AGENDA:**

1. Program and Code Analysis
2. Variables
   * All About Variables
   * Variable Naming Conventions
   * Variable Assignment Syntax **(`=` means assign!)** <br>
     `variable_name = ` <- Data to be assigned follows the `=` sign.
4. [General Shape Properties](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/generalShapeProperties)
5. Shortcut Operator Examples
     `n = n + 1` can be shortened to `n += 1` (a.k.a. "Increment by 1.")
     `n = n - 1` can be shortened to `n -= 1` (a.k.a. "Decrement by 1.")
     `n = n * 2` can be shortened to `n *= 2` (a.k.a. "Double.")
     `n = n / 2` can be shortened to `n /= 2` (a.k.a. "Halve.")
     *Note: Other values can be used as well.*     
6. Check for Understanding
7. Homework Head Start
