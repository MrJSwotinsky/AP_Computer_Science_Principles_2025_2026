      1. Navigate to the CMU Graphics sandbox and open the file <code>battery.py</code><br>
      2. Run <code>battery.py</code>.<br>
      3. Explore.
      <ul>
        <li>What happens when you click the 'Use' button?</li>
        <li>What happens when you click the 'Charge' button?</li>
      </ul>
      4. Examine the code.  
      <ul>
        <li>What new code structures do you notice?</li>
        <li>How might the code might be causing the program to do what it does?</li></li>

**AIM:** How can we leverage custom shape properties and shape methods to add additional interactive features to our programs?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.3</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can leverage custom shape properties and shape methods to add additional interactive features to my programs.

**AGENDA:**

1. Program and Code Analysis
2. Revisiting [Shape Properties](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/generalShapeProperties)
3. Custom Shape Properties
4. [Shape Methods](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/generalShapeMethods)
5. Check for Understanding
6. Homework Head Start

**HOMEWORK:**
