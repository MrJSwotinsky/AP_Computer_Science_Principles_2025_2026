**AIM:** How do programs store and use data?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.2</ins>: Apply computational thinking skills to a variety of tasks.
 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.3</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can describe what procedural abstraction is.
- [ ] I can identify the benefits of procedural abstraction.
- [ ] Given a procedure definition, I can determine the end results of a series of calls to the given procedure.

**AGENDA:**

1. Functions (aka Procedures)
2. What is Procedural Abstraction?
3. Benefits of Procedural Abstraction
4. Procedure Calls ([AP Pseudocode Reference)](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/AP_CSP_Exam_Reference_Information_2026.pdf)
    * ...involving DISPLAY().
    * ...on the coordinate plane.
    * ...involving robots that draw.
5. Check for Understanding
6. Homework Head Start
