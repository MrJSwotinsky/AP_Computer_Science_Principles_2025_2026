### General Shape Properties and Shape Specific Properties
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
      <code>centerX</code> is a <b>general shape property</b>.  It applies to <b>all</b> shapes, and refers to the x-coordinate of a shape's center.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify some other general shape properties.</li>
        <li>What does each shape property refer to.</li>
      </ul>
      <code>radius</code> is a <b>shape-specific property</b>.  It applies to <b>some, but not all</b> shapes, and refers to the radius of a shape (e.g. a star or a circle).<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify some other shape-specific properties.</li>
        <li>What shape(s) does each shape specific property apply to?
        <li>What does each shape property refer to.</li>
      </ul>

**AIM:** How can we leverage the `onMouseMove()` and `onMouseDrag()` functions to add additional interactive features to our programs?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.3</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can leverage the `onMouseMove()` and `onMouseDrag()` functions to add additional interactive features to my programs.

**AGENDA:**

1. Program and Code Analysis
2. [`onMouseMove()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMouseMove)
3. [`onMouseDrag()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMouseDrag)
4. "Pointers" vs. "Painters"
5. Check for Understanding
6. Homework Head Start

**HOMEWORK:**
