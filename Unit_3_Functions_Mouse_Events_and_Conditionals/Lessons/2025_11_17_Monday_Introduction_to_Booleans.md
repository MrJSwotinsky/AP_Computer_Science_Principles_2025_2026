**AIM:** What are booleans and what can they represent?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.2</ins>: Apply computational thinking skills to a variety of tasks.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can identify the two boolean values used by computer programs.
- [ ] I describe a variety of different ways to represent each boolean value and classify boolean expressions as either True or False.
- [ ] I can leverage boolean expressions to represent real life conditions.
- [ ] I can analyze logic gate diagrams.
- [ ] I can apply code tracing to determine the value(s) of one or more variables after executing a given code segment.

**AGENDA:**

1. Two Truths and a Lie
2. All About Booleans ([AP Pseudocode Reference)](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/AP_CSP_Exam_Reference_Information_2026.pdf)
3. Using Booleans to Represent Real Life Conditions
4. Logic Gate Diagrams
5. Code Tracing
6. Check for Understanding
7. Homework Head Start
