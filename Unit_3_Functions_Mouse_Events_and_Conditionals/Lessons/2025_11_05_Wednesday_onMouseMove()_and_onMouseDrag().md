      <b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
      1. Navigate to the CMU Graphics sandbox and open the file <code>pointer.py</code><br>
      2. Run <code>pointer.py</code>.<br>
      3. <b>Without clicking the mouse</b> move it across the canvas.  What happens?<br>
      4. Try clicking the mouse.  What happens?<br>
      5. Try clicking and dragging the mouse.  What happens?<br>
      6. Examine the code.  Based on your observations interacting with the program, what do you think the functions <code>onMouseMove()</code> and <code>onMousePress()</code> accomplish?<br><br>

**AIM:** How can we leverage the `onMouseMove()` and `onMouseDrag()` functions to add additional interactive features to our programs?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.3</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can leverage the `onMouseMove()` and `onMouseDrag()` functions to add additional interactive features to my programs.

**AGENDA:**

1. Program and Code Analysis
2. [`onMouseMove()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMouseMove)
3. [`onMouseDrag()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMouseDrag)
4. "Pointers" vs. "Painters"
5. Check for Understanding
6. Homework Head Start
