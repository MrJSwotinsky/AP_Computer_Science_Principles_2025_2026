**AIM:** How can we define and call our own functions in CMU Graphics?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.2</ins>: Apply computational thinking to a variety of tasks.
 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.3</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I know the essential ingredients of functions and function calls.
- [ ] I can write-student defined functions that draw images composed of a few shapes.
- [ ] I can call student-defined functions.
- [ ] I can navigate CMU Graphics lessons.

**AGENDA:**

1. Navigating CMU Graphics Lessons
