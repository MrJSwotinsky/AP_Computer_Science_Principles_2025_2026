      <b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
      Select OPTION 1, OPTION 2, or OPTION 3 below:<br><br>
      <b>OPTION 1:</b> What will the following code segment output?
<pre><code>val_1 = False
val_2 = val_1 == True
val_1 = val_1 == val_2
print(val_1)
print(val_2)</code></pre>
      <b>OPTION 2: </b>In order to participate in a school trip, a student must attend an orientation.  Students with GPA less than 80 will not be permitted to attend the trip. Using the variables, <code>attended_orientation</code>, which evaluates to <code>True</code> if a student attended the orientation, and <code>False</code> if the student did not, and the variable, <code>GPA</code>, to represent the students grade point average, write a boolean expression that will evaluate to <code>True</code> for all students able to attend the trip.<br><br>
      <b>OPTION 3: </b>Sketch a logic gate diagram that contains at least two levels.  What are some combinations of inputs that will result in an output of <code>True</code>? What are some combinations of inputs that will result in an output of <code>False</code>?
