## Requirements

1. Create an interactive image that represents you.  It is up to you to determine how...be creative!

2. In your code, include all of the following:
    * [ ] At least one student-student defined function that...
       * [ ] ...has at least one parameter.
       * [ ] ...is called at least two times in your program.
       * [ ] ...will execute different code segments depending on what argument is passed to a parameter.
    * [ ] At least one selection block (*a.k.a conditional block, a.k.a. if block*)
    * [ ] At least one variable with...
       * [ ] ...at least one custom property updated at least one time in your program.
       * [ ] ...a built-in property updated at least one time in your program.
    * [ ] [`onMousePress()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMousePress)
    * [ ] [`onMouseRelease()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMouseRelease)
    * [ ] [`onMouseMove()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMouseMove)
    * [ ] [`onMouseDrag()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMouseDrag)
    * [ ] [`onKeyPress()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onKeyPress)
    * [ ] [`onKeyRelease()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onKeyRelease)
    * [ ] [`.hits()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/generalShapeMethods#hits)
    * [ ] [`.hitsShape()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/generalShapeMethods#hitsShape)
    * [ ] [`visible`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/generalShapeProperties#visible)

3. Thoroughly comment your code in a way that explains and enhances the readability of your code without cluttering it.

4. Apply the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process to complete this task
     * [ ] Capture your engagement in the **Empathize**, **Define**, and **Ideate** stages of the design thinking process using your [design planner](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Planner.pdf).<br>*Remember, You may want to revisit these stages throughout the design thinking process.  If you do, be sure to capture it in your design thinking planner.*
     * [ ] As you **Prototype** and **Test**, remember to regularly commit.
        * [ ]  For each commit, include a **commit message** and a **description** to **describe** progress and **next steps**.
        * [ ]  Document at least **3** changes you made based on **peer feedback**.
        * [ ]  Document at least **2** change you made by **troubleshooting** and **resolving** an issue.

## Reflection

The final part of this task is to reflect on your work.  Write your reflection using [markdown](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Markdown_Reference.md) in the `README.md` file in your `Emoji Task` folder.  

Your reflection should consist of four to six well written paragraphs addressing the following prompts:
* What was the Interactive Image Task all about?
   * How does your interactive image represent you? 
* Describe your engagement in the design thinking process:
   * Who was your audience, what were their needs, feelings, and challenges, and how did your final product address the needs feelings and challenges of your audience?
   * What specific problem statement did you come up with as part of the define stage of the design thinking process?
   * What were some of the different ideas you came up with as part of the ideate stage of the design thinking process, what were the advantages and disadvantages of each, and how did you decide which one to use?
   * Describe the prototyping and testing stages of the design thinking process.  What challenges did you experience and how did you troubleshoot them? What feedback did you recieve from peers and how did it influence your work?
* Describe the specific skills you learned by completing the Interactive Image Task.
* Code Analysis Questions:
   * Describe the functionality of your program.  In other words, what does it do?
   * Provide one example of **input** in your program, and explain what your program does with that input, as well how that input contributes to the overall functionality of your program.
   * Provide one example of **output** in your program, and explain what causes that output to occur, as well as how that output contributes to the overall functionality of your program.
   * Identify one student-defined function in your program.
       * What is it's name?
       * In general, what does it do and how does it contribute to the overall functionality of your program?
       * Describe how it works in enough detail that another programmer could re-construct it.
   * What parameter(s) does your function accept?
   * Identify one function call in your program.
       * What argument(s) are passed to your function's parameter(s)?
       * As a result, what lines of code are executed?
       * As a result, what happens?
    * Describe a different function call that would result in different lines of code being executed.
       * What argument(s) are passed to your function's parameter(s)?
       * As a result, what different lines of code are executed?
       * As a result, what happens?
    * Identify one selection block (*a.k.a. conditional, a.k.a. if block*) in your program.
       * Overall, how does your selection block contribute to the overall functionality of your program?
       * Identify the first boolean in your selection block.
       * Identify a value that will cause it to evaluate to `True` and explain why that value will cause it to evaluate to `True`, and describe what will happen if it evaluates to `True`.
       * Identify a value that will cause it to evaluate to `False` and explain why that value will cause it to evaluate to `False`, and describe what will happen if it evaluates to `False`.       
* Looking back, what might you have done differently, and why?
* Looking forward, if given more time to continue developing your emoji, what might your next steps be?
