## Requirements

1. Create an interactive image that represents you.  It is up to you to determine how...be creative!

2. In your code, include all of the following:
    * [ ] At least one student-student defined function that...
       * [ ] ...has at least one parameter.
       * [ ] ...is called at least two times in your program.
       * [ ] ...will execute different code segments depending on what argument is passed to a parameter.
    * [ ] At least one selection block (*a.k.a conditional block, a.k.a. if block*)
    * [ ] At least one variable with...
       * [ ] ...at least one custom property updated at least one time in your program.
       * [ ] ...a built-in property updated at least one time in your program.
    * [ ] [`onMousePress()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMousePress)
    * [ ] [`onMouseRelease()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMouseRelease)
    * [ ] [`onMouseMove()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMouseMove)
    * [ ] [`onMouseDrag()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onMouseDrag)
    * [ ] [`onKeyPress()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onKeyPress)
    * [ ] [`onKeyRelease()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/onKeyRelease)
    * [ ] [`.hits()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/generalShapeMethods#hits) or [`.hitsShape()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/generalShapeMethods#hitsShape)

3. Thoroughly comment your code in a way that explains and enhances the readability of your code without cluttering it.

4. Apply the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process to complete this task
     * [ ] Capture your engagement in the **Empathize**, **Define**, and **Ideate** stages of the design thinking process using your [design planner](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Planner.pdf).<br>*Remember, You may want to revisit these stages throughout the design thinking process.  If you do, be sure to capture it in your design thinking planner.*
     * [ ] As you **Prototype** and **Test**, remember to regularly commit.
        * [ ]  For each commit, include a **commit message** and a **description** to **describe** progress and **next steps**.
        * [ ]  Document at least **3** changes you made based on **peer feedback**.
        * [ ]  Document at least **2** change you made by **troubleshooting** and **resolving** an issue.

            <b>Version History Matters!</b><br><br>
            ...It helps to document your engagement in the design thinking process.<br>

## Reflection

The final part of this task is to reflect on your work.  Write your reflection using [markdown](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Markdown_Reference.md) in the `README.md` file in your `Emoji Task` folder.  

Your reflection should consist of four to six well written paragraphs addressing the following prompts:
* What was the Interactive Image Task all about?
   * How does your interactive image represent you? 
* Describe your engagement in the design thinking process:
   * Who was your audience, what were their needs, feelings, and challenges, and how did your final product address the needs feelings and challenges of your audience?
   * What specific problem statement did you come up with as part of the define stage of the design thinking process?
   * What were some of the different ideas you came up with as part of the ideate stage of the design thinking process, what were the advantages and disadvantages of each, and how did you decide which one to use?
   * Describe the prototyping and testing stages of the design thinking process.  What challenges did you experience and how did you troubleshoot them? What feedback did you recieve from peers and how did it influence your work?
* Describe the specific skills you learned by completing the Interactive Image Task.
* Code Analysis Questions:
   * QUESTION(S) ABOUT FUNCTIONALITY OF PROGRAM, WHAT SPECIFICALLY IS SEEN IN THE VIDEO
   * What is one example of **input** in your interactive image video?
   * QUESTION ABOUT -> WHAT DOES YOUR PROGRAM DO WITH THAT INPUT
   * How does this specific input congribute to your overall interactive image?
   * What is one example of **output** in your interactive image?
   * What causes this specific output to occur?
   * How does this specific output contribute to your overall interactive image?
   * QUESTION(S) ABOUT FUNCTION, IN GENERAL WHAT IT ACCOMPLISHES (HOW IT CONTRIBUTES TO FUNCTIONALITY / MANAGES COMPLEXITY), HOW IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL PROGRAM, DETAILED DESCRIPTION (INCL CODE), FUNCTION NAME, PARAMETERS, ARGUMENTS PASSED TO PARAMETERS, HOW PARAMETERS ARE USED, HOW DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS RESULT IN DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF CODE RUNNING (WRITE 2 CALLS - ID THE ARGUMENT, LINES OF CODE RUN, AND RESULT OF EACH, WRITE A NEW PROCEDURE CALL NOT IN CODE THAT WILL CAUSE DIFFERENT LINES OF CODE TO RUN, WHAT WILL HAPPEN)
   * QUESTION(S) ABOUT CONDITIONAL, OVERALL WHAT IT ACCOMPLISHES (HOW IT CONTRIBUTES TO FUNCTIONALITY / MANAGES COMPLEXITY), BOOLEAN, WHAT WILL CAUSE IT TO EVALUATE TO TRUE AND WHY, WHAT HAPPENS IF IT EVALUATES TO TRUE, WHAT WILL CAUSE IT TO EVALUATE TO FALSE AND WHY, WHAT HAPPENS IF IT EVALUATES TO FALSE        
* Looking back, what might you have done differently, and why?
* Looking forward, if given more time to continue developing your emoji, what might your next steps be?
