1. Complete the **Empathize** column of your [design planner](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Planner.pdf) to capture your engagement in the Empathize stage of the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process.
2. Scan your design planner and save it as `LastNameFirstInitial_Emoji_Task_Design_Planner.png`.
3. Create a folder in your AP Computer Science Principles Portfolio repo titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_Emoji_Task`.
4. Upload your design planner to your Emoji Task folder.
