       Mr. Swotinsky has decided to break his <a href = https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Unit_1_Intro_to_CMU_Graphics/Tasks/Emoji_Task/Sample/SwotinskyJ_Emoji_Task_Emoji.png>scuba emoji</a> into different sections.  The sections he has chosen are:
      <ul>
        <li>Background</li>
        <li>Face (without eyes)</li>
