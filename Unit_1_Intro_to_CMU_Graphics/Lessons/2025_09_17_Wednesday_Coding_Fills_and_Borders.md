      2. Click the "Sandbox" button.<br>
      3. Delete any code that is currently in the sandbox.<br>
      4. Copy/Paste the following line of code into the sandbox, and click the green "Run" button.<br><br>
      <pre><code></code>Rect(0, 0, 100, 100, fill = 'Yellow', border = 'Purple', borderWidth = 10)</code></pre>
      5. Start exploring!
      <ul>
        <li>Try changing the position of the rectangle.  Which properties must be modified to accomplish this?</li>
        <li>Try changing the size of the rectangle.  Which properties must be modified to accomplish this?</li>
        <li>Try changing the fill color of the rectangle.  Which properties must be modified to accomplish this?</li>
        <li>Try changing the border color of the rectangle.  Which properties must be modified to accomplish this? Which colors work?  Are there any colors that don't work?</li>
        <li>Try changing the border size of the rectangle.  Which properties must be modified to accomplish this?</li>

**AIM:** How can we code borders and fills in CMU Graphics?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.3</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can customize the borders and fills or rectangles.
- [ ] I can select colors using CMU Graphics' built in colors as well as RGB values.
- [ ] I understand how layering works on the CMU graphics canvas.
- [ ] I understand the importance of precision in coding as well as the impact of not being precise.

**AGENDA:**

1. Border and Fill Exploration
2. The `fill`, `border`, and `borderWidth` Properties (a.k.a. Parameters)
3. The Importance of Precision
4. [CMU Graphics Built-In Colors](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/cpcs-docs/builtInColors)
5. [RGB Values](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+color+picker&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1075US1075&oq=google+color+pi&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDQgAEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyDQgAEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyBggBEEUYOTIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABKgCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on)(e.g. `fill = rgb(70,10,125)`)
6. Layering Shapes
7. Coding Practice
8. Check for Understanding
