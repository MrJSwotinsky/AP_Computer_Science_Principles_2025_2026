      1. Navigate to <a href = https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/>CMU Graphics</a>, and sign in.<br>
      2. Click the "Sandbox" button.<br>
      3. Delete any code that is currently in the sandbox.<br>
      4. Copy/Paste the following lines of code into the sandbox, and click the green "Run" button.<br><br>
<pre><code>Oval(100, 75, 100, 50)
Circle(300, 75, 50)
Star(100, 200, 50, 5)
Line(240, 200, 360, 200)
Polygon(100, 300, 50, 350, 150, 350)
Label('Hello, World!', 300, 320)</code></pre>
      5. Start exploring!
      <ul>
        <li>What new functions do you notice? Based on the output, what do you think each new function accomplishes? </li>
        <li>Pick one function and try changing the values assigned to its properties.  What do you notice?  What do you think each property controls?</li>
        <li>Try expanding the code by adding some of the properties you have learned about in previous lessons (e.g.<code>fill</code>,<code>border</code>,<code>borderWidth</code>, and <code>gradient</code>)

**AIM:** How can we code ovals, circles, stars, lines, polygons, and labels in CMU Graphics?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS61XT.3</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.
 
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can code ovals, circles, stars, lines, polygons, and labels in CMU Graphics
- [ ] I can customize ovals, circles, stars, lines, polygons, and label passing different values to their properties (a.k.a. passing different arguments to their parameters.)

**AGENDA:**

1. Shape Exploration
2. Arguments (Required Arguments vs. Optional Arguments)
3. [Ovals](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/oval)(`centerX`, `centerY`, `width`, and `height`)  
4. [Circles](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/circle)(`centerX`, `centerY`, and `radius`)  
5. [Stars](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/star)(`centerX`, `centerY`, `radius`,`points`, and `roundness`)  
6. [Lines](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/line)(`x1`, `y1`, `x2`,`y2`, and `lineWidth`) 
7. [Polygons](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/polygon)(`x1`, `y1`, `x2`,`y2`, `x3`, `y3`, etc.) 
8. [Labels](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/labeln)(`value`, `centerX`, `centerY`, `size`, `font`, `bold`, and `italic`)  
9. Introducing `Opacity`, `RotateAngle`, and other [general shape properties](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/generalShapeProperties) 
10. Check for Understanding
