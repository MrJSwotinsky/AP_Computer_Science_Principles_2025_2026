# Emoji Task Reflection

**Mr. Swotinsky**

The Emoji Task challenged me to apply what I learned about coding to help the owner of a scuba shop improve their shops's social media presence.  I selected the owner of a scuba shop as my intended audience because scuba diving is one of my hobbies.  

I began this task by engaging in the empathize stage of the design thinking process.  The empathize stage required me to consider the needs, feelings, and challenges of the owner of the scuba shop.  The owner of the scuba shop did not have any problems with repeat customers, but they needed help attracting new customers.  They also thought a weak social media presence might be part of the problem.  Since the owner seemed particularly excited about the idea of a scuba themed emoji, I defined the problem as: ***"In an effort to help the owner of a scuba shop improve their shop's social media presence, I need to design a personalized scuba-themed emoji that can be used in their social media posts, and is so creative that it not only improves their social media presence, but also attracts new customers."*** As part of the ideate stage of the design thinking process, I brainstormed three different ideas, first a fish emoji because scuba divers like fish, next a scuba face emoji, because it was specific and personal, and a finally scuba diver emoji, because it was also specific and personal.  I decided not to make a fish emoji because it was not specific enough, and I decided to make a full scuba diver emoji because it would have been too complicated.  So, I decided to create a scuba face emoji.

During the prototyping and testing stages of the design thinking process, I iteratively developed my emoji.  I started with the face and mask.  Then, I began working on the regulator.  As I continued working, I eventually added mask straps, a fish, and bubbles.  One of the challenges I had to troubleshoot was creating the air tube for the regulator.  I started by using an oval, but quickly realized that I would have to cover the top of the oval with a rectangle to hide it.  Then I ran into a problem with the rectangle blocking part of the regulator.  I eventually resolved this by changing the order of the shapes in my code.  I also made changes to my work based on peer feedback.  One peer suggested that I change my background to make it look more like my emoji was underwater.  So, I changed it from a solid color to a gradient. I recieved feedback from another peer who pointed out some coding requirements I was missing.  So, I added a label to the regulator which included the following code requirements: `Label()`, `size`, `font`, `bold`, and `italic`.

By completing this task, I developed many new skills.  For example, I learned what the design thinking process is and how I can use it to iteratively develop my work.  Some of the coding skills I learned include how to code rectangles, circles, ovals, stars, lines, polygons, and labels as well as how to customize shapes using a variety of different parameters.  I also learned about the importance of writing code comments to enhance the readability of my code without cluttering my work. Additionally, I learned about output.  One example of output in my emoji are the bubbles.  They are generated by lines 30 - 38 in my code, and they contribute to my overall emoji by enhancing the underwater look.

Looking back, I wish I had spent more time getting peer feedback.  The peer feedback I recieved helped me make significant improvements to my emoji.  I think more peer feedback would have helped me make it even better.  I also wish I had made my emoji a bit more colorful.  Looking forward, if given more time to continue developing my emoji, my goal for next steps would be to animate it.  For example, I wonder if there is any code I could write to make the fish swim or the bubbles move.  For now, I am confident that my emoji will help the scuba shop owner improve their social media presence and attract new customers.
