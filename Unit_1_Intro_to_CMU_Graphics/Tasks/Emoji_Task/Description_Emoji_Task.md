# Emoji Task

Apply what you have learned about coding shapes in CMU Graphics to code an emoji that represents you.

## To Be Submitted

Create a folder titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_Emoji_Task` to store the following deliverables for this task:

* [ ] Your Completed Design Planner  / filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_Emoji_Task_Design_Planner.png`
* [ ] Your Code (including a robust version history) / filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_Emoji_Task_Code.py`
* [ ] Your Emoji (including a robust version history) / filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_Emoji_Task_Emoji.png`
* [ ] Your Reflection / filename: `README.md`

**Check out this [example](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/tree/main/Unit_1_Intro_to_CMU_Graphics/Tasks/Emoji_Task/Sample) of what your final project should look like.**

## Requirements

1. Create an emoji that represents you.  It is up to you to determine how...be creative!

2. In your code, call **all** of the following functions:
    * [ ] [`Rect()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/rect)
    * [ ] [`Circle()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/circle)
    * [ ] [`Oval()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/oval)
    * [ ] [`Star()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/star)
    * [ ] [`Line()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/line)
    * [ ] [`Polygon()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/polygon)
    * [ ] [`Label()`](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/label)

3. In your code, pass arguments to **all** of the following keyword parameters:
    * [ ] `fill`
    * [ ] `opacity`
    * [ ] `border` 
    * [ ] `borderWidth` 
    * [ ] `rotateAngle`  
    * [ ] `roundness` 
    * [ ] `lineWidth` 
    * [ ] `size`
    * [ ] `font`
    * [ ] `bold` 
    * [ ] `italic` 
          
4. In your code, describe `fill` in **all** of the following ways:
    * [ ] [Built-In Colors](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/builtInColors)
    * [ ] [RGB Values](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/rgbValues) (Check out the [Google Color Picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+color+picker) for help creating custom colors.)
    * [ ] [Gradient](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/gradients)
  
5. Thoroughly comment your code in a way that explains and enhances the readability of your code without cluttering it.

6. Apply the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process to complete this task
     * [ ] Capture your engagement in the **Empathize**, **Define**, and **Ideate** stages of the design thinking process using your [design planner](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Planner.pdf).<br>*Remember, You may want to revisit these stages throughout the design thinking process.  If you do, be sure to capture it in your design thinking planner.*
     * [ ] As you **Prototype** and **Test**, remember to regularly commit.
        * [ ]  For each commit, include a **commit message** and a **description** to **describe** progress and **next steps**.
        * [ ]  Document at least **2** changes you made based on **peer feedback**.
        * [ ]  Document at least **1** change you made by **troubleshooting** and **resolving** an issue.
